## About The Project


Handling user accounts, especially in a large company, can be a very repetitive and time-consuming task. As the person responsible for creating all these accounts, I realized that we needed a simpler and faster way to bring new employees onboard. That's why I suggested automating and improving our onboarding process.

Here's why:
* Time Efficiency: By automating and streamlining our user account creation process, we'll be able to save a significant amount of time and effort. This means our new employees can get up and running faster, allowing us to operate more efficiently as a whole.
* Accuracy and Consistency: Automation ensures that every user account is created with precision and consistency. This reduces the chances of errors or discrepancies in user profiles, enhancing our data quality and overall security.
* Resource Savings: Automating repetitive tasks will free up our IT team's valuable time and skills. This can be channeled into more strategic projects, ultimately leading to resource savings and a more productive IT department.
