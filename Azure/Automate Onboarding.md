## About The Project


Handling user accounts, especially in a large company, can be a very repetitive and time-consuming task. As the person responsible for creating all these accounts, I realized that we needed a simpler and faster way to bring new employees onboard. That's why I suggested automating and improving our onboarding process.

Here's why:
* Time Efficiency: Automation can significantly reduce the time required to create user accounts. This means new employees can access the systems they need more quickly, boosting overall productivity.
* Accuracy and Consistency: Automated processes are less prone to human error. By using automation, you can ensure that each user account is created with consistent and accurate information, reducing the risk of issues and security vulnerabilities.
* Resource Savings: By automating repetitive tasks, you free up human resources to focus on more strategic and value-added activities. This can lead to cost savings and improved utilization of your IT team's skills and expertise.
